Make sure that the name does not conflict with any existing experiments.\n","\n","**Model Registration**: The model is registered with the name “MyModelRevenue”. If a model with this name already exists in the Model Registry, this could cause a conflict.\n","\n","**Data Split**: The data is split into training and test sets with a 70:30 ratio. Depending on the size and distribution of your data, you might want to adjust this.\n","\n","**Autologging**: Autologging is enabled with mlflow.spark.autolog(). This logs all parameters, metrics, and a model from spark.ml estimators and model transformers.
